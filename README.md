# Data Description
#### This dataset contains the flights information from 20 unique carriers in the U.S. in year 2008. This dataset has many interesting features like Month, DepTime(actuall departure time), CRSDepTime(scheduled departure time), ArrDelay(arrival delay, in minutes), DepDelay(departure delay, in minutes), origin(origin airport), dest(destination) etc.

# Sample Plots


#### Plot2: The map plot shows the relationship between different time scale(month/ day of month/ day of week) and the number of flights that each carrier has.

#### Plot3: The bubble plot shows the relationship between Average_Arrival_Delay and Average_Departure_Delay for each unique carrier. From this plot, we can see which carrier has the highest delay time in general. Users have choices of different months. To improve this plot, we are planning to mannually add the legend on side to show the full name for each carrier.
